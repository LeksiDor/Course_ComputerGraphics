## Programming Assignment for the course COMP.CE.430-2021-2022-1 Computer Graphics.

You can retrieve the code using git terminal:<br>
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LeksiDor/Course_ComputerGraphics.git


The project is mostly a refactored version of Vulkan tutorials: https://vulkan-tutorial.com

However, it features an automatic build system using CMake.
Also, a nicely composed Utilities library will help you to keep all boiler-plate code apart from the actual assignment.
It can even be used as a foundation for more serious Vulkan-based projects, after few extra steps of improvement.
